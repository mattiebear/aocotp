# AOCOTP!

An OTP-compliant solution to the Advent of Code 2024 challenge.

This really doesn't need to be an OTP application... but what's the fun in that!?

## How to Run

```sh
iex -S mix
```

And then when in the IEx shell:

```elixir
Aoc.day(1)
```

Or any other day you want. It log a `Result` struct to the console, at least until I add some formatting.
